# Web Frontend Template With Plain Typescript

This should be a minimalistic example for a web page with typescript.


## Development

The typescript source is located in the `src` folder. The HTML source is in the
 `web-frontend` folder.

 __Attention: the `web-frontent/js` folder will be genereated. Dont't modify code manually.__

To transpile the typescript code automatically, execute:
`npm run dev`

To run a local test webserver execute in an other terminal:
`npm run serve` and open `http://localhost:8000/` in a browser.


## Distributing

The distributable folder is `web-frontend`. To get a clean `js` folder, execute:
`npm run build`.
