# Web Frontend Template With Plain Typescript

This should be a minimalistic example for a web page with typescript.


## Development

The typescript source is located in the `src` folder. The HTML source is in the
 `web-frontend` folder.

 __Attention: the `web-frontent/js` folder will be genereated. Dont't modify code manually.__

To start development execute this command:
```
npm run dev
```

The local test webserver is reachable at `http://localhost:8000/`. You have to refresh
 the browser to execute the new transpiled code.


## Distributing

The distributable folder is `web-frontend`. To get a clean folder with the newest 
 code, execute:
```
npm run build
```
